# Task List Manager

## Overview

Task List Manager is a web application built using React, where users can manage tasks, filter them based on their status, and perform CRUD operations. The tasks are fetched from a dummy API (JSONPlaceholder), and users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks by their status (`To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`).

The app also supports a search functionality to filter tasks by their title or description.

## Features

- **Fetch Tasks**: Fetch tasks from a dummy API (JSONPlaceholder).
- **Add Task**: Add a new task to the list.
- **Edit Task**: Edit the title, description, and status of tasks directly in the table.
- **Delete Task**: Delete tasks from the list.
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by status (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
- **Search**: Search tasks by their title or description.
- **Pagination**: Tasks are displayed with pagination for better usability.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both mobile and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React-Tabulator**: For creating editable and responsive tables.
